Questions : 
-On File.java there is a lot of use of the java.net (for URL and URI) library, they are not ported in scala-native, shoud I: remove every function making use of it, keep them, or comment them in the wait of a future port of java.net ?
-For what used to be final statics fields, would it be "smart" to put them the lazy modifier ? 
-is it a good idea to user functionnal programming to rewrite java functions, or would it be better to really stuck to the way the original Java code was written ?
