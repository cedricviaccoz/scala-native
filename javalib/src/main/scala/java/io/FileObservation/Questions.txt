Questions : 

-
there is two implementation of the remove function 
one in windows that seems almost impossible to implement in scala-native, found here :
/classlib/modules/portlib/src/main/native/port/windows/hyfile.c
and the other in unix system found here which is just a call to stdio remove(const char * path)
/classlib/modules/portlib/src/main/native/port/unix/hyfile.c

for now, my project only use the unix implementation, but since I should try to have a cross platform version of java.io implemented, what do I do with windows ?

-

-
Where can i have my file.cpp to put it C functions i want to use ?
